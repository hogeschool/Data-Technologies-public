> 💡 **Note:**  
> The terms *cache-aside*, *write-through*, *write-back*, and *write-around* are widely used in practice, but they are **not formally standardized**. Different vendors (AWS, Redis, Azure, Hazelcast) may use slightly different descriptions. Always specify what you mean in your own design or documentation.
