# Introduction to Database Normalization

## What is Database Normalization?

Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970, the same visionary who introduced the relational model. It involves structuring data efficiently by dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable ones.

## Benefits of Normalization

- **Reduces redundancy:** Prevents duplication of data across tables.
- **Ensures consistency:** Helps maintain data integrity.
- **Improves performance:** Optimizes query execution and storage efficiency.

## Real-world Examples

Normalization is widely used in industries like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce to maintain clean and structured datasets. For example, an online store may separate customer details from order records to prevent duplication.

Think of normalization like organizing your wardrobe:

- 0NF: Everything is thrown in one drawer.
- 1NF: Shirts, pants, and socks are separated.
- 2NF: Shirts are sorted by type (T-shirts, dress shirts).
- 3NF: Dress shirts are sorted by color and size.
