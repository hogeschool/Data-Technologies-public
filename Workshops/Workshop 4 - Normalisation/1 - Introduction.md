# Introduction to Database Normalization

## What is Database Normalization?
Database normalization is a process used in designing relational databases to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity. It involves structuring data efficiently by dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable ones.

## Benefits of Normalization
- **Reduces redundancy:** Prevents duplication of data across tables.
- **Ensures consistency:** Helps maintain data integrity.
- **Improves performance:** Optimizes query execution and storage efficiency.

## Real-world Examples
Normalization is widely used in industries like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce to maintain clean and structured datasets. For example, an online store may separate customer details from order records to prevent duplication.
